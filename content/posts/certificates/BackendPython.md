I have acquired knowledge in Git & GitHub, Databases, Computational Thinking and Object Oriented Programming (OOP), all supported by Python and its most popular frameworks, such as FastAPI, Flask and Django, focusing mainly on the latter. 

Currently, I work mainly with FastAPI and Flask. I have used these frameworks in my Human vs. Animal project to serve the prediction models I developed. In addition, I use them regularly in my work as a Data Scientist to expose data analysis and statistical functionalities to the frontend.
